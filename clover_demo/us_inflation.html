            <h2>4. Expert Analysis on Inflation Drivers</h2>

            <h3>Federal Reserve Analysis</h3>
            <p>Initially viewed inflation as "transitory" (supply bottlenecks, demand surge, stimulus checks). Later recognized more persistent factors (supply contractions, demand increases, idiosyncratic factors).</p>

            <h3>Academic and Economic Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MIT Sloan emphasized federal spending as the "overwhelming driver" in 2022.</li>
                <li>Other studies highlighted supply chain disruptions.</li>
                <li>Some analyses pointed to the combination of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Current State and Outlook (March 2025)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall inflation: 2.4%</li>
                <li>Core inflation (excl. food/energy): 2.8%</li>
                <li>Services inflation remains primary driver (98% of overall).</li>
                <li>Shelter costs are the largest contributor (60%).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Federal Reserve has been gradually reducing interest rates, but concerns remain about potential resurgence (e.g., tariffs, trade tensions).</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The US inflation experience of 2021-2025 resulted from a complex interplay of pandemic disruptions, policy responses, and global events. While peak inflation has moderated significantly, the primary drivers shifted from goods and energy to services and housing. This analysis highlights inflation as a multifaceted challenge with varying impacts across the economy.</p>
