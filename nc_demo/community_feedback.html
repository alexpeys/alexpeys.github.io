            <h2 class="page-title">NC Miata Endurance Racing: Community Feedback and Consensus</h2>
            <p>This report summarizes community feedback on key components and approaches for NC Miata endurance racing, organized by vehicle system. It highlights areas of strong consensus versus controversial choices and includes direct quotes from experienced racers and builders.</p>

            <h3>1. Reliability Priorities</h3>
            <p>There is strong consensus that for endurance racing, reliability should be prioritized over maximum performance.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Grant - I run a 2007 MX-5 STL that puts out 210HP, 155 TQ at rear wheels on Dynojet. I bought 6 engines in 3 years, and not one of them would last one of your races. So be wary of building it to the max. I think if you build it to around 185HP you will have a great motor, capable of running the entire season." - Danny Steyn, professional racer [<a href="https://mazdaracers.com/topic/7003-nc-endurance-champcar-questions/" target="_blank">MazdaRacers.com</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"What Chris said. And if you want to play with cams and cam timing, build towards a broader torque curve rather than some arbitrary peak HP number. 'Area under the curve' should always be an important consideration but all the more so for endurance racing." - Forum member [<a href="https://mazdaracers.com/topic/7003-nc-endurance-champcar-questions/" target="_blank">MazdaRacers.com</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>2. Chassis and Suspension</h3>
            <h4>Consensus Items:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The NC chassis is considered a significant upgrade over NA/NB for endurance racing</li>
                <li>Coilovers are preferred over spring/shock combinations for adjustability</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Agreed with Goingnowherefast. NC chassis is a significant upgrade from the NA/NB. Little things like the usage of lightweight aluminum parts on the suspension helps reduce unsprung weight, and the engine is placed further back to essentially make it almost a mid-engine car." - prestosamsung [<a href="https://www.miataturbo.net/race-prep-75/chasing-nc-budget-enduro-103921/" target="_blank">MiataTurbo.net</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"In my experience, square 245 RE-71s on 9's on FM (Konis & springs) suspension was really good on an NC casual track car." - codrus [<a href="https://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/grm/nc-miata-suspension/228077/page1/" target="_blank">GrassrootsMotorsports.com</a>]</p>

            </blockquote>
            <h4>Rear Hub Issues:</h4>
            <p>Rear hub failures are a significant concern with strong consensus on preventative measures:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"We have had rear hubs break and literally snap off everything on that corner of the car! They will break at some time and need to be changed routinely depending on the amount of track time you put on them. We change the rear hubs and bearings out after every three track weekends. We also xray & cryogenic treat them." - [<a href="https://forum.miata.net/vb/archive/index.php/t-525214.html" target="_blank">forum.miata.net</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The guys at MER at MSRC say they replace rear hubs on endurance race cars every 25 hours. And that is with RX-8 upgrade." - semimojo [<a href="https://forum.miata.net/vb/showthread.php?t=756517" target="_blank">forum.miata.net</a>]</p>

                <li>Rear: Various options based on achieving proper brake bias</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Controversial Points:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether to upgrade to RX8 rear hubs (performance benefit vs. points penalty in some racing series)</li>
                <li>Whether the additional weight of the RX8 brake upgrade (~35 lbs) is worth the improved braking performance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Cooling Systems</h3>
            <h4>Strong Consensus:</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>A high-quality radiator and oil cooler are essential</li>
                <li>Electric fan is necessary despite weight penalty</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Trust me - run a SERIOUS fan - built MX-5's have serious cooling issues" - Danny Steyn [<a href="https://mazdaracers.com/topic/7003-nc-endurance-champcar-questions/" target="_blank">MazdaRacers.com</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Put a fan on the car, and ask the drivers to loose the 2 pounds you might save. The penalty for not having it is way to high---  One red flag or even slow yellow will be enough to turn it on." - [<a href="https://mazdaracers.com/topic/7003-nc-endurance-champcar-questions/" target="_blank">MazdaRacers.com</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Recommended Cooling Upgrades:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Radiator</strong>: Custom double-pass or triple-pass radiator (CSF, Griffin, Mishimoto)</li>
                <li><strong>Oil Cooler</strong>: MiataSpeed FPSpec "Smart Cooler" system or Mazda Motorsports Cup Oil Cooler Kit</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"We built a really nice double pass radiator for the Freedom grand am cars that solved that problem for us. We had no luck with commercially available radiators either." - Jim Drago [<a href="https://mazdaracers.com/topic/7003-nc-endurance-champcar-questions/" target="_blank">MazdaRacers.com</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>

                <li>Thermostatic vs. non-thermostatic oil coolers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Engine and Drivetrain</h3>
            <h4>Strong Consensus:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Target around 185HP for reliability rather than maximum power</li>
                <li>Focus on broad torque curve rather than peak power</li>
                <li>Early NC models (06-08) have weaker valve springs that should be upgraded</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The sealed mx5 motors were 100% stock and more like 157hp at the wheels. A full on stl mx5 isn't much over 200hp at the wheels and has a very short life span.

            </ul>

            <h3>6. Fuel System</h3>
            <h4>Consensus Items:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stock NC fuel tank capacity (12 gallons) is marginal for 2-hour stints</li>
                <li>Stock filler neck restricts refueling speed</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The stock NC fuel pipe to the stock fuel tank chokes down to a size that restricts the flow of fuel and prevents using fuel cans that have large openings. A fast flow can (1" id output) puts fuel in faster than the stock tank/filler pipe can take it and so the fuel 'burps' back out." - [<a href="https://www.miataturbo.net/race-prep-75/fuel-cell-nc-miata-race-car-109891/" target="_blank">MiataTurbo.net</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>

                <li>Venting is critical for quick refueling</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Typically you look at capacity needed (use burn calcs to determine total capacity for a 2 hour stint), then look at what size you'd need to make that fit, then what's actually readily available. Custom cells are an option, but more $$$" - [<a href="https://www.miataturbo.net/race-prep-75/fuel-cell-nc-miata-race-car-109891/" target="_blank">MiataTurbo.net</a>]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Controversial Points:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether a fuel cell is worth the complexity and setup challenges</li>
                <li>Some racers report significant issues with fuel cells:
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"We installed an RCI fuel cell in a first gen RX7 Endurance racer. Then spent two seasons getting it sorted, for fuel pickup in corners, foam going bad too fast, ethanol in gas destroying foam with no source of non-ethanol gas except race gas these days, weight distribution messing up handling, fuel pickup system working but not being durable enough, -10 AN venting still not being big enough for Hunsaker dump, vent line drooling fuel, lift pump over heating..." - [<a href="https://www.miataturbo.net/race-prep-75/fuel-cell-nc-miata-race-car-109891/" target="_blank">MiataTurbo.net</a>]</p>

                <li>Cooling system failures in hot conditions or with yellow flags</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weight vs. Reliability Tradeoffs:</h4>
            <p>Strong consensus that some weight penalties (cooling fans, proper brakes) are worth the reliability benefits:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Put a fan on the car, and ask the drivers to loose the 2 pounds you might save. The penalty for not having it is way to high." - [<a href="https://mazdaracers.com/topic/7003-nc-endurance-champcar-questions/" target="_blank">MazdaRacers.com</a>]</p>
