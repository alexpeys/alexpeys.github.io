            <h2 class="page-title" id="safety">Regulations for NC Miata in Endurance Racing Series</h2>

            <p>This document outlines the key regulations and requirements for building an NC Miata for endurance racing series such as Lucky Dog Racing League, ChampCar Endurance Series, and World Racing League. These guidelines will help inform your build decisions to ensure compliance with series rules while maximizing performance and reliability.</p>

            <h3>1. Safety Equipment Requirements</h3>

            <h4>1.1 Roll Cage Specifications</h4>
            <p>All endurance racing series require a properly designed and installed roll cage. While specific requirements may vary slightly between organizations, the following general specifications apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material</strong>: Most series require seamless or DOM (Drawn Over Mandrel) mild steel tubing. ERW (Electric Resistance Welded) tubing is typically not allowed.</li>
                <li><strong>Tube Dimensions</strong>: Typically 1.5" to 1.75" diameter with wall thickness of 0.095" to 0.120" depending on car weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Requirements</strong>: Must include main hoop, front hoop, side protection bars, and harness bar at minimum.</li>
                <li><strong>Installation</strong>: Professional installation is strongly recommended, with proper welding techniques required.</li>
                <li><strong>Padding</strong>: High-density roll bar padding is required on all cage components that could come in contact with the driver's helmet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1.2 Fire Suppression System</h4>
            <p>A fire suppression system is mandatory in all major endurance racing series:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type</strong>: Either SFI or FIA approved systems (specific requirements vary by series).</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity</strong>: Typically 5-10 lb systems with both cockpit and engine bay coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Activation</strong>: Must have both driver-accessible interior activation and external activation point.</li>
                <li><strong>Nozzle Placement</strong>: Multiple nozzles directed at fuel cell, engine, and driver compartment.</li>
                <li><strong>Certification</strong>: Systems typically require recertification every 2 years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1.3 Driver Safety Equipment</h4>
            <p>All drivers must have the following safety equipment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Helmet</strong>: Snell SA2020 or newer (FIA 8860-2018 also accepted in most series).</li>
                <li><strong>Head and Neck Restraint</strong>: SFI 38.1 or FIA 8858 certified device (HANS or similar).</li>
                <li><strong>Fire Suit</strong>: SFI 3.2A/5 or FIA 8856-2018 rated (or better) fire-resistant racing suit.</li>
                <li><strong>Underwear</strong>: Nomex or fire-resistant underwear, socks, and balaclava.</li>
                <li><strong>Gloves and Shoes</strong>: Fire-resistant racing gloves and shoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Arm Restraints/Window Nets</strong>: Required to prevent arms from extending outside the vehicle in a rollover.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1.4 Additional Safety Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Racing Seat</strong>: FIA or SFI approved racing seat securely mounted to the chassis or cage.</li>
                <li><strong>Harness</strong>: 6-point (minimum) SFI or FIA approved racing harness, properly mounted.</li>
                <li><strong>Master Electrical Cut-off Switch</strong>: Accessible from both inside and outside the vehicle.</li>
                <li><strong>Tow Hooks</strong>: Front and rear tow hooks for recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Window Nets</strong>: Driver's side window net meeting SFI or FIA specifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Vehicle Classification and Modification Restrictions</h3>

            <h4>2.1 ChampCar Endurance Series</h4>
            <p>ChampCar uses a points-based system to value race cars:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>NC Miatas are assigned a base point value (approximately 400 points based on forum discussions).</li>
                <li>Total vehicle value cannot exceed 500 points without incurring penalty laps.</li>
                <li>Performance modifications (suspension, engine, brakes, etc.) add points to the base value.</li>
                <li>Forum discussions indicate that NC Miatas with basic modifications (header, coilovers, sway bars) typically start with a 4-lap penalty in B class.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2.2 Lucky Dog Racing League</h4>
            <p>Lucky Dog Racing League has specific car classification systems, though detailed information about NC Miata classification was not available in the accessible documentation.</p>

            <h4>2.3 Common Modification Considerations for NC Miata</h4>
            <p>Based on forum discussions from experienced builders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hubs/Brakes</strong>: RX8 front hubs are a common upgrade for improved durability. Stock rear hubs are typically retained to avoid point penalties.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooling</strong>: Enhanced cooling is critical. Consider removing or modifying components in front of the radiator and adding hood venting.</li>
                <li><strong>Engine</strong>: Stock engines with fresh bearings are generally reliable. Some builders recommend a 2.5L swap with 2.0L head for improved performance and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Suspension</strong>: Coilovers and adjustable sway bars are common modifications but may incur point penalties in some series.</li>
                <li><strong>Differential</strong>: RX8 differential mount is recommended for improved durability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Fuel Capacity and Refueling Rules</h3>
            <p>While specific details were limited in the accessible documentation, endurance racing series typically have strict regulations regarding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fuel Cell</strong>: Safety fuel cell with FIA or SFI certification is typically required or strongly recommended.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity</strong>: NC Miatas have approximately 12-gallon stock capacity, which may be insufficient for longer stints in endurance racing.</li>
                <li><strong>Refueling Procedures</strong>: Most series require fire-resistant clothing for refueling crew, fire extinguishers present during refueling, and specific procedures for driver changes during refueling.</li>
                <li><strong>Pit Stop Duration</strong>: Some series mandate minimum pit stop durations (Lucky Dog Racing League mentions 5-7 minute mandatory pit stops in some documentation).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Driver Change Procedures</h3>
            <p>Driver changes are a critical component of endurance racing strategy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timing</strong>: Most series require driver changes at specific intervals (typically 1-2 hours maximum stint time).</li>
                <li><strong>Procedure</strong>: Driver changes must be conducted in designated pit areas with the engine off.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety Equipment</strong>: Incoming driver must be fully equipped with safety gear before entering the vehicle.</li>
                <li><strong>Combined Activities</strong>: Many teams coordinate driver changes with refueling and maintenance activities to minimize pit time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Key Reliability Considerations for NC Miata in Endurance Racing</h3>
            <p>Based on forum discussions from experienced builders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cooling System</strong>: Enhanced cooling is critical. Consider additional oil coolers and proper ducting.</li>
                <li><strong>Brakes</strong>: Upgraded pads and rotors designed for endurance use are essential.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrical System</strong>: Simplified and reliable electrical systems with redundancy for critical components.</li>
                <li><strong>Lighting</strong>: Upgraded lighting for night racing portions of endurance events.</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Consumption</strong>: Engine tuning for optimal fuel economy to maximize stint length.</li>
            </ul>
