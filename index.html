							<h2>About Me</h2>
								<div class="entry">

								<p>I am a research scientist at Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research. I'm interested in understanding learning and decision-making (human and machine). I am also interested in causal inference and causal discovery, which I view as important components towards having truly smart decision-makers (again, either human or machine).
								</p>

								<p>I'm also a huge fan of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/data-science-for-social-good/10152669477928859" target=new>data science for civic improvement and social good</a>. Check out a cool <a href="https://seanjtaylor.github.io/out-for-justice/" target=new>project</a> a bunch of us built at a hackathon sponsored by Bayes Impact.</p>

								<p>My work has been published in a number of academic journals and I've written popular press articles for <i>WIRED</i> and <i>New York Times</i>.</p>

								<p>Before Facebook I was a joint post-doc with <a href="http://www.daverand.org" target=new>David Rand</a> at the Human Cooperation Lab (Yale Psychology) and Martin Nowak at the <a href="http://www.ped.fas.harvard.edu" target=new>Program for Evolutionary Dynamics</a> (Harvard Biology). I completed my PhD in Economics at Harvard University under the watchful eyes of <a href="awesomeadvisers.jpg">Al Roth, Drew Fudenberg, David Laibson and Uma Karmarkar.</a></p>

									<h3>2016</h3>
									<div class="paper">"Detecting heterogeneous treatment effects by combining observational and experimental data" (with Akos Lada) <br> (Submitted) [Arxiv] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: A simple recipe: use observational data to estimate unit-level causal effects, these estimates are biased but can be an input into your favorite experiment-based heterogeneous treatment effects detector. We show when and why this can make estimation of heterogeneous effects in randomized trials easier.
									</i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"Learning causal models from many experiments: meta-analysis with regularized instrumental variables" (with Dean Eckles) <br> [Arxiv coming soon] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: How can we combine hundreds or thousands of randomized trials to learn generalizable knowledge? Use modified IV methods!
									</i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"Paying (for) Attention: The Impact of Information Processing Costs on Bayesian Inference" (with Xiaosheng Mu and Scott Kominers) <br> [<a href="http://www.scottkom.com/articles/Kominers_Mu_Peysakhovich_Paying_For_Attention.pdf" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] (under review) </br>
									<small><i>Summary: What happens to learning if Bayesian updated is even slightly costly? Turns out, things can get arbitrarily bad.
									</i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"The Good, the Bad, and the Unflinchingly Selfish: Cooperative Decision-Making Can Be Predicted with High Accuracy Using Only Three Behavioral Types" (with Ziv Epstein and Dave Rand) <br>
									<i>Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Economics and Computation (EC2016)</i>
									[<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2737983" target="new">SSRN PDF</a>] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: We can predict cooperation decisions pretty well using only a small amount of heterogeneity. However, this heterogeneity is not captured by demographics or standard personality psychology variables (eg. the Big 5).</i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"Using Methods from Machine Learning to Evaluate Models of Human Choice Under Uncertainty" (with Jeff Naecker) <br>
									Forthcoming in <i>Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</i>
									[<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2548564" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: We compare ML models to economic models of decisions under risk and ambiguity. Economic models do surprisingly well in risk but there is room for improvement in ambiguity. ML can be used as a useful benchmark to see whether there is room for improvement in formal behavioral modeling.</i></small></div>

									<h3>2015</h3>
									<div class="paper">"When Punishment Doesn't Pay: 'Cold Glow' and Decisions to Punish" (with Aurelie Ouss) </br>
									<i>Journal of Law and Economics</i> (December 2015) [<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2247446" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>]
									</br>
									<small><i>Summary: People's intuitions about punishment don't fit with normative models of economics of crime. What kind of outcomes result when individuals set punishment levels in games? They're not great.  </i></small>	 </div>

									<div class="paper">"Asymmetric Impacts of Favorable and Unfavorable Information on Decisions Under Ambiguity" (with Uma Karmarkar) </br>
									<i>Management Science</i> (2015) [<a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/AmbigMainTextFinal_8a88b410-0618-40ea-969a-c29f3e509d9d.pdf" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2233" target="new">Journal Version</a>] [<a href="http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/suppl/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2233" target="new">Data and Code</a>]
									</br>
									<small><i>Summary: When information supports a favorable outcome, it strongly increases valuation of an ambiguous financial prospect. However, when information supports an unfavorable outcome, it has significantly less impact. Unfavorable information decreases estimates of a good outcome occurring, but also reduces aversive uncertainty. These factors act in opposition, minimizing the effects of unfavorable information. </i></small>
									</div>

									<div class="paper">"Habits of Virtue: creating norms of cooperation and defection in the laboratory" (with David Rand) </br> <i>Management Science</i> (2015) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2294242" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2168" target="new">Journal Version</a>] [<a href="http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/suppl/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2168" target="new">Data and Code</a>] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: Why are some groups of people more cooperative than others? We argue that people internalize strategies that they learn are successful in their daily social interaction. Thus, interacting in environments where cooperation is advantageous (due to effective “rules of the game”) causes individuals to adopt cooperation as their default behavior more generally. We show these spill-over effects experimentally.</i></small>
									</div>

									<div class="paper">"Recency, Records and Recaps: Learning and Non-equilibrium Behavior in a Simple Decision Problem" (with Drew Fudenberg) </br><i>Proceedings of EC 2014</i>, to be reprinted in <i>Transactions on Economics and Computation</i> [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2339862" target="new">Revised Version PDF</a>] [<a href="http://alexpeys.github.io/recaps_appendix.pdf" target="new">Online Supplement</a>]</br>
									<small><i>Summary: People make mistakes. An important question is whether repeated experience with a situation will lead individuals to behave optimally. The human tendency to discount past information (recency bias) can lead to persistent sub-optimal decision-making. WSimple informational interventions or "recaps" can be used to mitigate the worst impacts of the bias.</i></small>
									</div>


									<h3>2014</h3>
									<div class="paper">"Cooperating with the future" (with Oliver Hauser, David Rand and Martin Nowak) </br><i>Nature</i> (2014) [<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13530.html"
									target="new">Published Version</a>] [<a href="http://davidrand-cooperation.com/s/Hauser_et_al_data_and_code.zip"
									target="new">Data and Code</a>] </br>
									<small>
									<i>Nature video summary available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrXyRJV96mk&feature=youtu.be" target=_new>here</a> (it's good)</br>
									Summary: The existence of pro-social preferences lead to institutional designs which are impossible in the standard model. We show how properly designed mechanisms which harness pro-social preferences can achieve good outcomes while poorly designed mechanisms can lead to huge social welfare losses.</i></small>
									</div>

									<div class="paper">"Humans display a 'cooperative phenotype' that is domain general and temporally stable" (with Martin Nowak and David Rand) </br> <i>Nature Communications</i> (2014) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2426473" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140916/ncomms5939/full/ncomms5939.html" target="new">Journal Version</a>] [<a href="https://daverand.squarespace.com/s/peysakhovich_2014_data_and_code.zip" target="new">Data and Code</a>]</br>
									<small><i>Summary: Is there a unified underlying trait that we can call "cooperativeness" or is each cooperation decision completely unique? Can we study this trait using simple stripped down economic games? Is propensity to cooperate related to other social behavioral such as propensity to punish non-cooperators or to competitiveness?</i></small>
									</div>

									<div class="paper">"Why We Cooperate" (with Jillian Jordan and David Rand) </br>
									<i>Jean Decety & Thalia Wheatley (eds.) “The Moral Brain: Multidisciplinary Perspectives”</i> (2014) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2418439" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: Prosocial behavior is a key part of human life. Why do individuals pay costs to give benefits to others? We provide a brief survey to introduce non-specialists into the literature. </i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"Social Heuristics Shape Intuitive Cooperation" (with David Rand, Gordon Kraft-Todd, George Newman, Owen Wurzbacher, Martin Nowak and Joshua Greene) </br><i>Nature Communications</i> (2014) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2222683" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140422/ncomms4677/abs/ncomms4677.html" target="new">Journal Version</a>] [<a href="http://davidrand-cooperation.com/s/Rand_et_al_2014_Nature_Comm_data_and_code.zip" target="new">Data and Code</a>]</br>
									<small><i>Summary: In a large meta-analysis we show that intuition favors cooperation while reflection leads to defection in one-shot cooperation games. We also that previous experience with behavioral experiments can undermine the effectiveness of time pressure as a decision-making manipulation. </i></small>
									</div>

									<div class="paper">"How to Commit (If You Must): Commitment Contracts and the Dual-Self Model" </br><i>Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</i> (2014) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2444434" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268114000365" target="new">Journal Version</a>] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: This paper looks at three types of commitment technologies: carrot contracts (rewards for ‘good’ behavior), stick contracts (fines for ‘bad’ behavior) and binding commitment. Carrots turn out to work the best in a Fudenberg-Levine style dual self model.</i></small>
									</div>

									<h3>2012</h3>
									<div class="paper"> "A Note on Proper Scoring Rules and Risk Aversion" (with Mikkel Plagborg-Moller) </br><i>Economics Letters</i> (2012) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2019078" target="new">Ungated Working Paper</a>] [<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176512002984" target="new">Journal Version</a>] <br>
									<small><i>Summary: Proper scoring rules are incentive schemes to make individuals report their true beliefs. We show that risk aversion causes individuals to "compress" their belief ratios toward 1 and discuss potential mechanisms for solving the risk aversion problem.</i></small></div>
