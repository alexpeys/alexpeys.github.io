									<div class="paper">"Paying (for) Attention: The Impact of Information Processing Costs on Bayesian Inference" (with Xiaosheng Mu and Scott Kominers) <br> [<a href="http://www.scottkom.com/articles/Kominers_Mu_Peysakhovich_Paying_For_Attention.pdf" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] (under review) </br>
									<small><i>Summary: Human information processing is often modeled as costless Bayesian inference. However, research in psychology shows that attention is a computationally costly and potentially limited resource. We study a Bayesian individual for whom computing posterior beliefs is costly. Such an agent faces a tradeoff between economizing on attention costs and having more accurate beliefs. We show that even small processing costs can lead to significant departures from the standard costless processing model. There exist situations where beliefs can cycle persistently and never converge. In addition, when updating is costly, agents are more sensitive to signals about rare events than to signals about common events. Thus, these individuals can permanently overestimate the likelihood of rare events (e.g., the probability of a plane crash). There is a commonly held assumption in economics that individuals will converge to correct beliefs/optimal behavior given sufficient experience. Our results contribute to a growing literature in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics suggesting that this assumption is both theoretically and empirically fragile.

									<div class="paper">"The Good, the Bad, and the Unflinchingly Selfish: Cooperative Decision-Making Can Be Predicted with High Accuracy Using Only Three Behavioral Types" (with Ziv Epstein and Dave Rand) <br> [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2737983" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] (under review) </br>
									<small><i>Summary: The human willingness to pay costs to benefit anonymous others is often explained by social preferences: rather than only valuing their own material payoff, people also care in some fashion about the outcomes of others. But how successful is this concept of outcome-based social preferences for actually predicting out-of-sample behavior? We investigate this question by having 1067 human subjects each make 20 cooperation decisions, and using machine learning to predict their last 5 choices based on their first 15. We find that decisions can be predicted with high accuracy by models that include outcome-based features and allow for heterogeneity across individuals in the weights placed on those features (AUC=0.89). It is not necessary, however, to have a fully heterogeneous model -- excellent predictive power (AUC=0.88) is achieved by a model that specifies three behavioral types based on cooperation frequency in the 15 training trials: those who cooperated at least half the time, those who cooperated less than half the time, and those who never cooperated. Finally, we provide evidence that this inclination to cooperate cannot be well proxied by other personality/morality survey measures or demographics, and thus is a natural kind (or "cooperative phenotype").</i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"Detecting heterogeneous treatment effects by combining observational and experimental data" (with Akos Lada) <br> [Under Revision] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: Personalization is very important because every policy choice will have different effects on different units (eg. groups or individuals). However most randomized trials are underpowered to identify these heterogeneous effects. This is especially true when the set of unit-level attributes is high dimensional and our priors about which particular covariates will be important are weak. However, there are often observational data sets available that are orders of magnitude larger. We propose a simple method to combine these data sources to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. As an application, we show how our method can be used to improve Facebook page recommendations.

									<div class="paper">"Using Methods from Machine Learning to Evaluate Models of Human Choice Under Uncertainty" (with Jeff Naecker) <br> [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2548564" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] (revise and resubmit) </br>
									<small><i>Summary: How can we incorporate tools from machine learning (ML) into understanding human choice under uncertainty? We suggest that ML models can be used as benchmarks for the power of a theory by comparing its out of sample error to that of a black box model optimized for predictive accuracy, we call the latter concept ‘explainable variance’. We use an online platform to collect a large data set of individuals indicating their willingness to pay to play uncertain lotteries. We find that models that attempt to fit a single risk profile to a large population do very poorly. However, in the domain of risk, a version of expected utility that allows for non-linear probability weighting (as in cumulative prospect theory) and individual-level parameters performs as well out-of-sample as ML techniques. By contrast, in the domain of ambiguity, two of the most widely studied models (a linear version of maximin preferences and second order expected utility) fail to compete with the ML methods. We open the “black boxes” of the ML methods and examine the actual functions that have been learned. In risk our ML methods essentially “rediscover” expected utility with probability weighting. In the context of ambiguity we show that the form of ambiguity aversion implied by our ML models indicates a non-linear relationship between ambiguity and the ambiguity “penalty”. This suggests that there is gain from theoretical work on a portable model of ambiguity aversion. Our results highlight ways in which behavioral scientists can incorporate ML techniques in their daily practice to gain genuinely new insights.</i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"When Punishment Doesn't Pay: 'Cold Glow' and Decisions to Punish" (with Aurelie Ouss) </br>
									<i>Journal of Law and Economics</i> (December 2015) [<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2247446" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>]
									</br>
									<small><i>Summary: Normative models in economics of crime generally take a cost-benefit view of crime and punishment. Higher levels of punishment have costs but they can also deter individuals from crime. Thus, to make decisions about setting levels of punishment this viewpoint takes into account include the total social costs, social benefits, total levels of punishment and probability of "being caught". However, many punishment decisions are made by individuals (eg. voters, judges, juries). We ask: what parameters do individual decisions about punishment of a norm-breaker respond to? We show that individuals respond to own cost (but not toal cost), own contribution to punishment (but not total levels) and are insensitive to probability of defectors being caught. This can create situations where punishment levels are either too high or too low relative to "economic" optima. We discuss how these insights can explain otherwise puzzling legal phenomena. Our results also show the importance of incorporating real features of human psychology into institutional design.   </i></small>	 </div>

									<div class="paper">"Asymmetric Impacts of Favorable and Unfavorable Information on Decisions Under Ambiguity" (with Uma Karmarkar) </br>
									<i>Management Science</i> (2015) [<a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/AmbigMainTextFinal_8a88b410-0618-40ea-969a-c29f3e509d9d.pdf" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2233" target="new">Journal Version</a>] [<a href="http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/suppl/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2233" target="new">Data and Code</a>]
									</br>
									<small><i>Summary: Most daily decisions involve uncertainty about outcome probabilities arising from incomplete knowledge, i.e. ambiguity. We explore how the addition of partial information affects these types of choices using theoretical and empirical methods. Our experiments in both gain and loss domains demonstrate that when such information supports a favorable outcome, it strongly increases valuation of an ambiguous financial prospect. However, when information supports an unfavorable outcome, it has significantly less impact. We find that two mechanisms drive this asymmetry.  First, unfavorable information decreases estimates of a good outcome occurring, but also reduces aversive uncertainty. These factors act in opposition, minimizing the effects of unfavorable information. Second, when information can be subjectively interpreted, unfavorable information is less likely to be integrated into evaluations. Our findings reveal mechanisms not captured by traditional models of decision-making under uncertainty and highlight the importance of increasing the salience of unfavorable information in uncertain contexts to promote unbiased decision-making.  </i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: What explains the variability in norms of cooperation across cultures and organizations? A partial answer comes from considering the Social Heuristics Hypothesis: people internalize strategies that they learn are successful in their daily social interaction. Thus, interacting in environments where cooperation is advantageous (due to effective “rules of the game”) causes individuals to adopt cooperation as their default behavior more generally. We show these spill-over effects experimentally further demonstrating the role of experience and institutional environment in the construction of social preferences.</i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: People make mistakes. An important question is whether repeated experience with a situation will lead individuals to behave optimally. We focus on the human tendency to discount past information, aka recency bias, and show experimentally that this bias can lead to persistent sub-optimal decision-making. We also show how simple informational interventions or "recaps" can be used to mitigate the worst impacts of the bias.</i></small>

									<i>Nature video summary available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrXyRJV96mk&feature=youtu.be" target=_new>here</a> (it's good)</br>
									Summary: Traditional economic mechanism design takes as a primitive self-interested rational actors. However, humans are often pro-social and willing to pay costs to give benefits to others even in the absense of external incentives to do so. The existence of these preferences lead to institutional designs which are impossible in the standard model. We study the context of intergenerational public good provision and show how properly designed mechanisms which harness pro-social preferences can achieve good outcomes while poorly designed mechanisms can lead to huge social welfare losses.</i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: Cooperation is the willingness to pay costs to give benefits to other persons or groups. We ask three questions about commonly made assumptions. Is there a unified underlying trait that we can call "cooperativeness" or is each cooperation decision completely unique? Can we study this trait using simple stripped down economic games? Our data suggests that the answer to both of these questions is yes. We also ask: is propensity to cooperate related to other social behavioral such as propensity to punish non-cooperators or to competitiveness? We find no relationships between these behaviors in the data, suggesting they may be three orthogonal individual-level characteristics.</i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: Prosocial behavior is a key part of human life. Why do individuals pay costs to give benefits to others? We provide a brief survey to introduce non-specialists into the literature on how cooperation can be maintained in relationships (direct reciprocity), groups (indirect reciprocity, institutions) as well as one mechanism which may help to explain some of the "irrational" cooperation we see in the world (the Social Heuristics Hypothesis). </i></small></div>

									<small><i>Summary: Dual process theories in psychology argue that decisions can be thought of as a interplay between a set of fast/affective/automatic/intuitive processes and a set of slow/reflective/cognitive processes. How does this distinction play out in decisions about prosocial behavior? We present a meta-analysis of 15 time pressure studies conducted over a two year period and argue that there is strong evidence that for many (but not all) people, intuition favors cooperation while reflection leads to "economically rational" behavior. We discuss the moderators of this effect as well as show that previous experience with behavioral experiments can undermine the effectiveness of time pressure as a decision-making manipulation. </i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: How can individuals fight their self-control problems and implement long run favored behaviors? This paper looks at three types of commitment technologies: carrot contracts (rewards for ‘good’ behavior financed by borrowing from future consumption), stick contracts (self imposed fines for ‘bad’ behavior) and binding commitment. The model argues for the use of carrots over either sticks or binding commitments. This is for several reasons: sticks are highly vulnerable to trembles (while carrots are not), sticks and binding commitments create a temptation to cancel them (while carrots do not), and finally carrots allow easy tradeoffs between commitment and flexibility (while sticks and binding commitments do not).</i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: Proper scoring rules are incentive schemes to make individuals report their true beliefs. It is well known that these are not incentive compatible in the presense of risk aversion. We show that risk aversion causes individuals to "compress" their belief ratios toward 1 and discuss potential mechanisms for solving the risk aversion problem when the risk aversion distribution of the population is known and independent of the beliefs individuals hold.</i></small></div>
