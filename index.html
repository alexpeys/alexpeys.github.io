							<h2>About Me</h2>
								<div class="entry">

								<p>I am a behavioral economist on the Core Data Science team at Facebook. These days I'm interested in how to combine tools from machine learning with those of social and behavioral science to improve the outputs of both. In addition I've worked and continue to work on a variety of topics including
									<ul>
									<li> how individuals make decisions under uncertainty and learn about the world
									<li> why people help others and contribute to public goods even when they have nothing to gain
									<li>understanding the interaction of culture and formal rules
									<li> how to design institutions taking into account human psychology
									<li>how self-control works.
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>I'm also interested in the growing movement that uses data science tools for civic improvement and social good. You can get more information on this important trend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/data-science-for-social-good/10152669477928859" target=new>here</a> or check out a cool project my collaborators and I built <a href="https://seanjtaylor.github.io/out-for-justice/" target=new>here</a>.

								<p>Before Facebook I was a joint post-doc with <a href="http://www.daverand.org" target=new>David Rand</a> at the Human Cooperation Lab (Yale Psychology) and Martin Nowak at the <a href="http://www.ped.fas.harvard.edu" target=new>Program for Evolutionary Dynamics</a> (Harvard Biology). I completed my PhD in Economics at Harvard University under the watchful eyes of <a href="awesomeadvisers.jpg">Al Roth, Drew Fudenberg, David Laibson and Uma Karmarkar.</a></p>

									<div class="paper">"Using Machine Learning to Inform Behavioral Theory and Experiments" (with Jeff Naecker) [Coming soon!] (2014) </br>
									<small><i>Summary: Both behavioral sciences and machine learning techniques have been used to try to predict individual decision-making. We compare the effectiveness of models from behavioral economics to machine learning approaches in the domain of choice under uncertainty. We find that in the domain of risk, existing economic models can match and sometimes outperform machine learning approaches. However, in the domain of ambiguity machine learning models do far better. This suggests that there are potential gains from further developments of simple and tractable models of ambiguous decision-making.</i></small></div>

									<i>Nature video summary available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrXyRJV96mk&feature=youtu.be" target=_new>here</a> (it's good)</br>
									Summary: Traditional economic mechanism design takes as a primitive self-interested rational actors. However, humans are often pro-social and willing to pay costs to give benefits to others even in the absense of external incentives to do so. The existence of these preferences lead to institutional designs which are impossible in the standard model. We study the context of intergenerational public good provision and show how properly designed mechanisms which harness pro-social preferences can achieve good outcomes while poorly designed mechanisms can lead to huge social welfare losses.</i></small>

									<div class="paper">"The Cooperative Phenotype" (with Martin Nowak and David Rand) </br> <i>Nature Communications</i> (2014) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2426473" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>]</br>
									<small><i>Summary: Cooperation is the willingness to pay costs to give benefits to other persons or groups. We ask three questions about commonly made assumptions. Is there a unified underlying trait that we can call "cooperativeness" or is each cooperation decision completely unique? Can we study this trait using simple stripped down economic games? Our data suggests that the answer to both of these questions is yes. We also ask: is propensity to cooperate related to other social behavioral such as propensity to punish non-cooperators or to competitiveness? We find no relationships between these behaviors in the data, suggesting they may be three orthogonal individual-level characteristics.</i></small>

									<div class="paper">"Habits of Virtue: Creating Norms of Cooperation and Defection in the Laboratory" (with David Rand) </br> Revision Requested at <i>Management Science</i> [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2294242" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>]</br>
									<small><i>Summary: What explains the variability in norms of cooperation across cultures and organizations? A partial answer comes from considering the Social Heuristics Hypothesis: people internalize strategies that they learn are successful in their daily social interaction. Thus, interacting in environments where cooperation is advantageous (due to effective “rules of the game”) causes individuals to adopt cooperation as their default behavior more generally. We show these spill-over effects experimentally further demonstrating the role of experience and institutional environment in the construction of social preferences.</i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: People make mistakes. An important question is whether repeated experience with a situation will lead individuals to behave optimally. We focus on recency bias, or the tendency to discount past information and show when this bias can lead to persistent sub-optimal decision-making. We also show how simple informational interventions or "recaps" can be used to mitigate the worst impacts of the bias.</i></small>

									<small><i>Summary: Prosocial behavior is a key part of human life. Why do individuals pay costs to give benefits to others? We provide a brief survey to introduce non-specialists into the literature on how cooperation can be maintained in relationships (direct reciprocity), groups (indirect reciprocity, institutions) as well as one mechanism which may help to explain some of the "irrational" cooperation we see in the world (the Social Heuristics Hypothesis). </i></small></div>

									<div class="paper">"Social Heuristics Shape Intuitive Cooperation" (with David Rand, Gordon Kraft-Todd, George Newman, Owen Wurzbacher, Martin Nowak and Joshua Greene) </br><i>Nature Communications</i> (2014) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2222683" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140422/ncomms4677/abs/ncomms4677.html" target="new">Journal Version</a>]</br>
									<small><i>Summary: Dual process theories in psychology argue that decisions can be thought of as a interplay between a set of fast/affective/automatic/intuitive processes and a set of slow/reflective/cognitive processes. How does this distinction play out in decisions about prosocial behavior? We present a meta-analysis of 15 time pressure studies conducted over a two year period and argue that there is strong evidence that for many (but not all) people, intuition favors cooperation while reflection leads to "economically rational" behavior. We discuss the moderators of this effect as well as show that previous experience with behavioral experiments can undermine the effectiveness of time pressure as a decision-making manipulation. </i></small>

									<div class="paper">"When Punishment Doesn't Pay: 'Cold Glow' and Decisions to Punish" (with Aurelie Ouss) </br>
									Revision Requested at <i>Journal of Law and Economics</i> (2014) [<a href="" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>]
									</br>
									<small><i>Summary: Normative models in economics of crime generally take a cost-benefit view of crime and punishment. Higher levels of punishment have costs but they can also deter individuals from crime. Thus, to make decisions about setting levels of punishment this viewpoint takes into account include the total social costs, social benefits, total levels of punishment and probability of "being caught". However, many punishment decisions are made by individuals (eg. voters, judges, juries). We ask: what parameters do individual decisions about punishment of a norm-breaker respond to? We show that individuals respond to own cost (but not toal cost), own contribution to punishment (but not total levels) and are insensitive to probability of defectors being caught. This can create situations where punishment levels are either too high or too low relative to "economic" optima. We discuss how these insights can explain otherwise puzzling legal phenomena. Our results also show the importance of incorporating real features of human psychology into institutional design.   </i></small>	 </div>

									<div class="paper">"Asymmetric Impacts of Favorable and Unfavorable Information on Decisions Under Ambiguity" (with Uma Karmarkar) </br> Revision Requested at <i>Management Science</i> [Under revision]</div>

									<div class="paper">"How to Commit (If You Must): Commitment Contracts and the Dual-Self Model" </br><i>Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</i> (2014) [<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2444434" target="new">Working Paper PDF</a>] [<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268114000365" target="new">Journal Version</a>] </br>
									<small><i>Summary: How can individuals fight their self-control problems and implement long run favored behaviors? This paper looks at three types of commitment technologies: carrot contracts (rewards for ‘good’ behavior financed by borrowing from future consumption), stick contracts (self imposed fines for ‘bad’ behavior) and binding commitment. The model argues for the use of carrots over either sticks or binding commitments. This is for several reasons: sticks are highly vulnerable to trembles (while carrots are not), sticks and binding commitments create a temptation to cancel them (while carrots do not), and finally carrots allow easy tradeoffs between commitment and flexibility (while sticks and binding commitments do not).</i></small>
